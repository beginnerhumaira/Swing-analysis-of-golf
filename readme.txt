Golf Swing Analysis using MediaPipe Pose
Overview
This code uses MediaPipe Pose to analyze a golfer's swing and estimate their overall swing accuracy. It calculates the angles of the elbow, hand position, shaft, and knee, and then uses these angles to estimate the overall accuracy of the swing.

Requirements
1.Python 3.x
2.OpenCV (cv2)
3.MediaPipe (mp)
4.Feel free to use your own pictures

Usage
Replace "golf.jpg" with the path to your golf swing image.
Run the code using Python (e.g., python golf_swing_analysis.py).
The code will output the estimated elbow angle, hand position angle, shaft angle, knee angle, and overall swing accuracy.
The output image will be saved as golf_swing_analysis_extended.jpg in the same directory.
Code Explanation
The code consists of the following steps:

1.Load the golf swing image using OpenCV.
2.Initialize MediaPipe Pose and convert the image to RGB format.
3.Perform pose detection using MediaPipe Pose.
4.Calculate the angles of the elbow, hand position, shaft, and knee using the detected landmarks.
5.Estimate the overall swing accuracy based on the calculated angles.
6.Create a text image with the calculated angles and overall accuracy.
7.Concatenate the original image with the text image and save the output.
Note:
This code is for demonstration purposes only and may require adjustments for specific use cases. The ideal angle ranges used in the estimate_overall_accuracy function are example values and may need to be adjusted based on the specific golf swing style or instructor feedback.
